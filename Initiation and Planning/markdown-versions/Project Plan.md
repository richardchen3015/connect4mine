# Project Plan

## Target System
This application is meant to be run cross-platform on any device that supports Java. The release of Java does not matter as long as it is  
a version of JRE 8.

## Technologies to be Used
This project will utilize a variety of technologies in its development. One developer will be using Atom and Intellij to develop the Java
code, while the other will be using Netbeans. To foster collaboration, a source code repository in the form of Github will be used. To
encourage communication, the chat platform Discord will be used. Both project management documents were made with Markdown using plain text
editors. The algorithm will be created using Google Docs. Flaticon will be used for any icons necessary for our project. All copyright usage
is under the terms of fair use, as this project is strictly for education purposes.

## Scope of the Project
### Final List of Deliverables
- title page with instructions and a variety of game modes to choose from
- creation of a point object to represent connect 4 pieces
- creation of a game state object to represent the current situation on the board
- creation of effective minimax AI for the player to play against
- creation of timer object for the user to limit time of games
- creation of a mechanism to track the number of moves and possibly end the game once a move total has been reached
- creation of a checking algorithm to observe if the game is over
- creation of a file management system to load game states into the connect 4 application
- addition of menu bars to exit the application or save the game
- an instructions document to tell the player how to play connect 4

## Role Distribution
The role distribution will be loosely based on the schedule posed through the Gantt chart attached. However, our group has taken into
account that any further level of detail in planning role distribution will be for naught, as changes in scope will drastically change
this role distribution. Hence, our group will be discussing role distribution for a particular segment of the project at the beginning of
its indicated time on the Gantt chart. If any scope changes are to be made in the middle of a segment, a meeting will be held to split the
new roles in a way that is fair and equitable.

## Risk Management
We recognize the risk that may be posed by having uncoordinated testing environments and different versions of our code and seek to fix
this with the usage of version control and proper communication.
Version control will be done using Github. Before either developer makes any edits to the program, they will check that their testing
environment uses only the most updated files, identical to those on the shared repository. After editing or adding files, developers
will commit all of their changes immediately to the repository.
To cover any issues that may come up, Discord will be used  as the primary method of communication for this project. This software was
chosen due to its ubiquity and ease of use for a team of two users. Meetings will be held twice a week to discuss the state of the project
and any changes that need to happen.
As this is the first time that the members of this project are working collaboratively on a project, there are many steps that need to be taken
to ensure that there are no issues with collaboration. Proper communication is key to this, as many situations such as both of us writing
the same class at the same time can simply be avoided with communication.

Change management will be introduced with both members of the development team needing to communicate before implementing any change of scope through Discord.

## Change Management
Understanding that changes in scope and the specification for our project
are inevitable, the following system will be implemented to deal with
such changes.

##### Step 1 - Receiving the Request
The request could be received either directly from Mr. A or from the specification.
If it was from the specification, this could just be a change in scope due to
a misunderstanding of the specification.

##### Step 2 - Impact Analysis
The developers will now have a meeting to discuss the implications of this change
in scope on the project. Here, the time taken to make the change, the different
methods that need to be changed, and impact on the overall schedule of the project
will be considered.

##### Step 3 - Finalization
Before beginning to implement the change, the developers will have one final
meeting to discuss the project. If this will prevent the team from finishing
a much larger portion of the project, then the change in scope will be put on hold
until the end of the project to implement. However, if the change is urgent, it will
be implemented immediately.

##### Step 4 - Implementation
The change should be implemented after much communication between the developers.
This step varies greatly with each different scope change.

##### Step 5 - Review
The developers will have one final meeting to discuss the success/failure of the
change management procedure. If there are any large issues with the change, we may
have to redo this procedure or request an extension. Otherwise, this change management procedure is finished.
